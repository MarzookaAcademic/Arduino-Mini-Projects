# Ultrasonic Distance Sensor using Arduino

This project measures the distance of an object using the **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** and displays the result on the **Serial Monitor**.

## üß© Components
- Arduino Uno or Nano  
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- Jumper Wires  
- Breadboard (optional)

## ‚ö° Working
1. The HC-SR04 sends an ultrasonic pulse via the **TRIG** pin.  
2. The pulse reflects off an object and is received on the **ECHO** pin.  
3. Arduino calculates the time taken and converts it to distance.  
4. The result is printed on the Serial Monitor.

## üìü Circuit Connections

| HC-SR04 Pin | Connect To (Arduino) | Description         |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| VCC          | 5V                   | Power supply        |
| GND          | GND                  | Ground connection   |
| TRIG         | D9                   | Trigger signal pin  |
| ECHO         | D10                  | Echo signal pin     |
